## Portfolio Website

### Overview

This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website. The website was developed as a project for a UX Design class where I created a prototype in Figma. The goal of this project was to bring the design to life using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS, and to showcase my skills in web development.

### Development Process

#### Design Phase

1. **Prototyping:**
   - Created the initial design prototype using Figma.
   - Focused on creating a user-friendly interface with a clear layout, color scheme, and typography.

#### Coding Phase

1. **Setup:**
   - Initialized a new project repository and set up basic HTML structure.
   - Integrated Bootstrap framework for responsive design and component styling.
   - Added Tailwind CSS for additional styling and utility-based customization.

2. **Challenges Faced:**
   - **Learning Curve with Bootstrap:**
     - Bootstrap was new to me, and I faced challenges understanding how to use its grid system and components effectively.
     - **Solution:** Revisited course materials in College Brightspace and Bootstrap documentation to get a better grasp of its features. Hands-on practice with small projects helped me become more comfortable with Bootstrap.
   - **Styling and Customization:**
     - Customizing Bootstrap components to fit my design requirements was sometimes tricky.
     - **Solution:** Used additional CSS to override Bootstrap defaults and align the styles with my design. This included adjusting padding, colors, and fonts.
   - **Responsive Design:**
     - Ensuring that the website looked good on various screen sizes required careful testing and tweaking.
     - **Solution:** Employed media queries to make responsive adjustments and used Bootstrap’s built-in classes to handle different viewports.

#### Learning Outcomes

- **Mastery of Bootstrap:** Gained hands-on experience with Bootstrap, understanding its grid system, components, and utilities.
- **Enhanced CSS Skills:** Improved CSS skills by writing custom styles to complement Bootstrap’s default design.
